TL;DR

```console
npx adcpe
```

I'm a full stack developer who leans a bit more towards front, but I'm not afraid of deployments or creating migrations.

JavaScript was my first language and I learned Ruby later. I enjoy working with VueJS, Ruby on Rails, React and Node.js. I have also worked with PHP and Laravel. Lately I've been using PNPM instead of NPM or Yarn and it has clicked for me.

Besides code, I like music, (watching) sports and sushi.
